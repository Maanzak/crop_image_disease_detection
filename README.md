# crop_image_disease_detection
This project involves the application of the YOLOv5 object detection model to detect and classify crop diseases from images. It includes preparing a dataset in YOLO format, training the model, and evaluating its performance using precision, recall, mAP (mean Average Precision), and confusion matrices.
